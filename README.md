### Goal
The project is to create a SPA to display and browse the top news of the News API endpoint. The API is free for development purposes but the content coming from the server is limited to 260 characters.

Below you'll find some wireframes for inspiration, you are not required to implement them 100% like this.

The aim of this exercise is to show us how you think about code to solve the problem at hand. The primary criteria for judgment are basic software engineering and architectural principles.

### Functionality
A way to switch between countries, e.g. US and UK
An overview of the top news items and a way to access the detail page
A search to filter the news
